    "\n",
    "The stock market has been studied by many as people hope to find ways to make excess profits. People attempt to read company reports or mathematical equations or even view satellite images to evaluate and trade stocks. In this case we will be using machine learning to complete the same tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis of all of these prediction attempts comes from the idea of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). EMH states that a stock's price incorporates all of the information (historic, public, private) available in the market. There are 3 markets forms in EMH: weak-form, semi-strong form, and strong form. The weak form market explains that the market price of a stock incorporates only historical information. This means that investors are only able to obtain excessive gains if that have access to public and private information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we plan to disprove the weak-form efficient market as we want to use historical prices and technical analysis as inputs into a neural network in order to predict the perfect buy-in and sell-out times and get excessive gains than the standard buy-and-hold method. There are 3 approaches explained below: multi-class classification, binary classification, and regression."

    "The Bollinger Bands indictors is a kind of volatility indictor which uses the moving average over a portion of days and finds a certain standard deviation above and below that moving average. This indictor relies on the theory of mean reversion where asset prices, after spikes in price changes, revert towards the moving average of price. This indictor also shows how volatile an asset is; if the bands are farther apart, then the more volatile the asset is. Traders may use this strategy by buying an asset when the price reaches the lower standard deviation and then sell at the higher standard deviation. Usually, traders use 2 standard deviations away from the mean and have a moving average window of 20 periods."

In the paper, they use neural networks to predict 3 different actions: sell, buy, hold (do nothing). This may seen difficult to get the true labels, however the paper also goes in depth on how to calculate the true values of selling, buying, or holding. By scanning the data, we can find the minimum and maximum values within a window. The minimum value would be the buy signal and the maximum value would be the sell signal. All other values will be hold. Below is a reconstruction of that method."

    "We would need to create a training, validation, and test set. The training set would need to have more data then the validation and test set. For each training iteration, the model will learn the weights of the features using the training set and test these weights on the validation set. The validation set is needed to test if the model is over fitting to the training set. We can determine this through the loss function which will be explained in greater detail below in the training section. After all the training is done, the model is then ran on the test set data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the sequential order of time series data, we can no do a traditional train-test split.

    "## The Model (LSTM)\n",
    "An LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) network is a type of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network). The LSTM model does a great job at using older and more recent data to make predictions about the current state because it has 3 gates in which data flows through: an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. This forget gate allows the network to emphasis information that is more important and needed for predictions. This gate also determines how much of the sequence input data should be used for the prediction and how much should be remembered for the next prediction. This is more advanced than an RNN as an RNN does not have this gate. RNNs are able to use long inputs of data but suffer from the exploding and vanishing gradients effect when back propagating through the network This  Because of this feature of the forget/memory gate, it is a very popular network to use on time-series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch provides a very good LSTM model. We can use this PyTorch LSTM model as a part of our overall network. The LSTM model has input, output, number of LSTM layers, and dropout parameters. the input and output layers are standard for network modules. The LSTM layer parameter explains how many LSTM should be used on the input data recurrently. The dropout parameter can be used to remove/ignore nodes when training to explore other features. This would reduce chances of the model over-fitting on the training data. In the LSTM module, it can only be applied if there are more than 1 LSTM layer as dropout would act between LSTM layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification, the input layer would have the number of features, which in this case is 17. The output layer would be 1 because we are predicting the probability of 3 class values representing buy, sell, or hold.\n"

If it is too low, then it would take too long to train or get stuck at a local minimum. This is why we need to tune it.\n",

    "The hidden size refers to the number of neurons to be set for the hidden layer. This would slightly change the network in allowing to to break up the features into components of different weights. More hidden sizes means more weights to be assigned and tunned and therefore, leads to more time to train. More hidden sizes also a means a more complex model which can be prone to overfitting. Less hidden sizes means that the model may have trouble weighing the features properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout was explained above in the model section. If there is too much dropout, then the model will throw away too much information about the features and not learn much. If there is too little dropout, then the model may overfit to the training data.\n",

    "Lastly, the optimizer used can be tuned. There are 2 main optimizers: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam. SGD is know to generalize well and Adam is known to be more specific to the data. SGD is also know to converge faster than Adam. Both of these optimizers can lead to different results for loss and therefore we should try both.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also want the model to predict a buy/sell more often than a hold. If the classes were equal weighted, then the model will find that the lowest loss value would be obtained by predicting hold or no action at every time step. This is not useful. In order to avoid this, we can throw in class weights to our loss function (Cross Entropy). These weights can be computed by using the frequency of the class in the training set. This means that the lower frequency of the class, the higher importance of predicting it in training, the higher the weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually for training models, we would oversample using SMOTE, but that would much harder with a time-series dataset where values must be predicted based on the last X days of data points."

We also saw that this could be because of the loss function. Cross entropy loss does not take into account time steps; so this means that if the model prediction was off by one day or 100 days, the loss function would compute the same value. We tried to created a custom loss function in PyTorch, but was not possible to throw in the index of the training sample and compare that to the predicted value's index as well. If there was a way to allow the number of days to be included in a classification loss function, then this task would be much easier to train and predict.\n",

Using the next day's closing price, we can label the true class value to be either an increase in price (up) or a decrease in price (down). Our trading strategy would be to buy at every predicted increase in price and sell at every predicted decrease in price."

    "After working on this model, my next step was to instead of predicting direct trading decisions, we can use a machine learning model to give us prediction that we can use as a way to compute trading decisions. The binary classification model can suffer random shocks to the market that allow the price to randomly increase between days. This is not as helpful to the model as the model needs to see a trend of numbers and then needs to predict the next action/number. This leads us to regression."

    "In order to see how well our model predicts, we need to visualize the data and its predictions. We need to also assign how a bot would trade based on the predicted changes in price. This can be done by creating thresholds of predict changes and using buy/sell signals based on if the price changes past those specified thresholds. In this case, the default threshold is .15% on both sell and buy. This means that if the predicted price has a higher than .15% percent change from the previous price, then we would buy (if positive increase) or sell (if negative decrease). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This function also reflects a brokage system where the bot can set a stop loss. A stop loss is a way for investors to limit the amount that they could potentially lose in an investment. It is similar to a safety net where if a trade does not go their way, they can only lose a set amount. In this case the stop_loss would be 1.5% by default. If the bot buys and the investment actually falls 1.5%, then the bot will automatically sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After predicting using the training, validation, and test set, we can plot the prediction regression line along with the buy and sell signals. If the sell signal was a result of a stop loss, it would be in purple.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: All graphs used the model trained above. The model used a learning rate of .0001, hidden size of 64, dropout of 0.2, number of layers of 2, and an adam optimizer. This model training was much faster than the classification models.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are many ways to evaluate this model, which include comparing the number of days to true buy and sell signals, however we found that the best way would be to evaluate this model to a benchmark of buying and holding. Every trader attempts to beat the buy-and-hold method which is buying the asset at the beginning of a certain time and then not selling it and allowing it to, hopefully, appreciate in price over time. A trader want to profit off of each upward trend. So we can use the buy and sell signals along with their prices to see how much money the bot would have made and compare that to the price difference at the beginning and at the end."

    "Honestly, the regression model does much, much better than I expected. Even though it was not able to exactly get the correct prices for each of the time steps, it was able to capture the trends as seen by the validation red regression line. Because of this, it was able to make a significant profit on more volatile data in the test set as it was still able to make a profit of $88 per share. It seems that the model seems that it is more sensitive to selling rather than buying. This is seen through the validation results as the model does a better job when trading and using the bot compared to buying and holding. This threshold of buying and selling can be adjusted for optimal results in the training and validation sets. After some more training, resources, features, and time, I believe that I can make this model close to, if not beat, the buy and hold method."

    "\n",
    "Predicting the stock market is a very difficult tasks as there are over thousands of variables that are incorporated and many of them can not be quantified. Many banks, hedge funds, data scientists, and average retail investors try to create bots that can figure out the secrets to the market and beat it over and over again. Even the people that do get a winning strategy would not share it with the industry, making the research in this field much harder. When starting this project, I did not expect to get outstanding results. My main goal was to learn about the research and work done in this field in regards to machine learning and apply my course knowledge to a personal project. Throughout this project, I found that since I was not able to consistently beat the market, the Efficient Market Hypothesis still stands as I was not able to use historical information in order to make excess gains."

    "- Long training time with better training resources (GPUs on AWS)\n",
    "- More hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- Connecting trading bot to an API brokage (Alpaca)\n",

    "- Create a portfolio of stocks rather than just one stock trading\n",
